# Antipatterns in Evangelical Discourse

As someone who used to be an evangelical Christian, I've heard my fair share of sermons and read my fair share of Christian books and blogs. I've found a few things frustrating, so over the course of several of these rants I'm going to have a bit of a rant about them.

I'm hoping this rant will help anyone receiving these content streams to notice a few antipatterns, and avoid getting sucked into fruitless controversy. I'm hoping it will help anyone discussing these content streams to avoid taking on the antipatterns themselves when discussing with real people. And if I'm quite lucky, I'm hoping I'll help a few authors notice their own antipatterns and reduce them as much as they can. Without further ado, the first rant.

## Antipattern #1: Mudslinging

Mud-slinging: To make malicious or scandalous allegations about an opponent with the aim of damaging their reputation.[^1]
