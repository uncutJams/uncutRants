# What You Need To Know To Go To Heaven - Critique

## Summary
[What You Need To Know To Go To Heaven | Romans 6:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deaFSi-9bX4&list=WL&index=3&ab_channel=HopeReformedBaptistChurch) is a sermon by Tom Foord, a conservative, evangelical, baptist pastor who's the president of the [Fellowship of Evangelical Churches of Australia](https://feca.org.au/our-team). He sums up the sermon pretty well himself:

> This is how you get to heaven - know that your life is deathly and disgusting and you will find no joy in it outside of Jesus; know secondly that where you are headed is an eternal hell for the punishments of your sins; know thirdly that the father has in love given his son to give you eternal life in grace; and then lastly know that this eternal life is in Jesus Christ.

I found both the overall message of the sermon, and the details throughout it, to be unfounded and emotionally manipulative. I've tried to step through it and outline in what ways I found it to be so. I wanted to publish these thoughts, because:

1. As the pastor of a church, a speaker on a YouTube channel, and the president of a group of churches, Tom does have a bit of a sphere of influence, and I'm worried this could cause harm within that sphere;
2. I think this message and this mode of delivery is not exclusive to Tom, but is a pattern within some subsets of conservative evangelicalism.

## Critique

> Tonight's aim and tonight's goal is to show us and ensure that everybody… knows the path from here to heaven with the Lord Jesus Christ… I'm not trying to do anything underhanded, I'm not trying to trick you - tonight's stated aim if you are outside of the Lord Jesus Christ .. is that you would behold the Lord Jesus Christ in his gospel and get saved and escape hell…

Look, I guess it’s better than not that he’s up front, but this isn’t a get out of jail card for being manipulative, and Tom certainly is emotionally manipulative. No attempt is made to reason and convince someone that heaven or hell or God or Satan are real - people are repeatedly told that they cannot trust their own minds if they disagree with Tom/Paul, speaking on behalf of God, and literal infinite suffering is threatened if you don’t listen and obey.

> We're going to be in Romans 6:23 allow me to read… Here it is Wonder of Wonders, the promise of God: ‘for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord…’ The first reality you need to know to get to heaven - the way that your life is heading if you are not yet a born again Spirit-filled with the love of God from within Christian in Christ Jesus, is towards hell and towards death and the whole of your life smells like it…
>
> Maybe you're just a regular Australian and you've just not done a lot of thinking about eternal life and what happens after you've died - because the Devil is a wily beast, he's smart, he's fairly successful and he's got you to this point in your life without spending much time thinking about it - he's kept you distracted, he's kept you thinking about other things and concerned about other matters, but you have not genuinely thought ‘where am I going after I die?’
>
> The reality is this that if you are not bending the knee to Jesus as Lord… then you are a slave - you're a slave to the devil, to your own sin - and the things that you feel identify you or or that you get to define yourself by - your inner desires - those are actually the shackles that bind you to the punishment bench - you are a slave to sin, that's what Paul says.

_‘The reason you haven’t thought about whether this specific afterlife claim is true, is because a malevolent evil being is tricking you.’_ - this is such a wild and unjustified claim. No attempt to demonstrate that this is the case is given - not even from anything like a thorough exegesis, but even that ought to be preceded by some attempt to justify the bible itself, given this is aimed at non-Christians. The framing is powerful - if a big evil thing is trying to stop you from becoming a Christian, it must be pretty bad to not be a Christian. And if non-Christians disagree - well, maybe it’s just because of the big evil thing tricking them?

So why should we trust Tom and/or Paul on this?

> And what Paul means by that is that that you don't ultimately have all this nonsense that goes flying out in philosophy and some people trying to act religious with this language of free will - that if by free will you mean I determine my own outcomes, I choose my own lifestyle I do
> what I think best and I only ever do what I choose for myself - that all is a well-veiled lie, there is no such thing as a liberated free righteous will.

So under a certain definition of free will I don’t believe in free will either, though it is notorious for having a bunch of conflicting definitions. I do believe in free action.

But also, there’s so much written about free will in philosophy from all different sides, including a lot of people claiming to be Christians, and even a few claiming to be reformed. I feel it is pretty arrogant to dismiss it all as nonsense without fleshing out and justifying your own position.

Further, it sounds like Tom is claiming Arminians (or whichever one isn’t the country) are using a 'well-veiled lie', and are ‘acting religious’, which is a strong claim to make about fellow Christians.

> You know what - you have an enslaved will, you have a dead will - so that everything you do you're doing because sin causes you to do it. You're chasing after the desires and the lusts of your flesh, whether it be sexual or possessions or popularity or or whatever it may be - every one of us outside of Jesus and before Jesus are slaves to sin.

So yes, everyone acts in accordance with their desires normally, sure. And depending on how you define it, some of those desires could be sin? But it seems Tom has deliberately named only the nasty sounding desires. What about the desire to care for your family? The desire to seek the truth? The desire to show mercy to the poor, widows and orphans? Do non-Christians have those desires? Are those desires sin?

If he thinks non-Christians don't have those desires, then I think Tom’s arguing in bad faith. I think that’s a ridiculous claim to make - it’s ignoring half of the world or so’s claims about their own minds, and there’s nothing they say or do that can convince you otherwise.

If he thinks that non-Christians do have those desires, but those desires are just sinful too, fair enough - but it is still emotionally manipulative to only list the nasty sounding ones.

> When you (a non-Christian) woke up Sunday afternoon at the butt crack of sunset hair in a mess from Saturday night, and here you are just in enjoying yourself - and you roll over and think ‘I bet my sucker Christian friends are all lining up for church again right now, I bet somebody's going to ask for their money, and somebody's going to ask them to dress nice and they're going to sit there and listen to somebody talking and and then they'll go home they won't even go and get plastered again Sunday night, they'll go and they'll act all righteous, and do their boring lifestyle, they'll go Monday they won't watch pornography, they won't flirt with the girls in the office, they won't get the attention of the guys like I do, they won't do whatever they please - cuz they're just boring loser Christians' - that's that's how many people think of Christians, if you're a Christian, it's how they think of you, you're welcome.

Jeez. So Tom clearly has some pretty shallow and unkind non-Christian friends, but I would again argue, not all (in fact, very few) non-Christians roll out of bed on Sunday afternoon and think anything of the sort. For one, many of us don’t go around thinking about how much better off our day is to someone else’s. Further, many of us don’t get smashed, don’t watch porn, and don't flirt with our co-workers. For another, many Christians do all of those things, none of them are exclusively non-Christian by any means. So please, don’t tell Christians that this is how everyone else is and how they think of them, that’s just false and damagingly isolating.

> It's a terribly honest question, because if you were to be honest and you were to list out your search history or your your your relational escapades or your failures or your immoralities, the real person that you are with the real history and the real lifestyle that you lead from your heart - you would recognize exactly what Paul says next which is that you have led and produced a shameful life that if people people were to put it up on a big screen tonight, or your internet history and all of your group chats and all of your personal messages have all been printed out and handed into the bulletin tonight and everybody's going to have a read - every one of us would feel a deep and disgusting shame, and that's just in front of other sinful people. Imagine what God sees.”

Ah yes, the videotape question. This is a classic metaphor in a lot of evangelistic talks.

I’ve certainly done things I think are bad, and I regret that. But I am confident that I could (and in fact already have with all the significant stuff) tell my partner anything I’ve done, and - knowing I regret the bad things I’ve done - she’ll still love me. And I’m extremely confident she won’t have any desire to burn me in hell forever. So sure, I’ve got embarrassment, regret - why does that imply it’s fine for God to burn me and just about everyone else in hell forever?

Side note: us millennials don't send stuff we're deeply ashamed and embarrassed about to group chats.

> There's all sorts of deathly symptoms that are already starting to smell on you - there's corruption, there's filth, there's disgust, there's guilt in your heart, there's hatred towards other people, there's malice in your actions, there's jealousy towards others, there is a there's a despising of other people's good, there's a hatred of God… you can polish yourself up well and you put on your good button-up shirt so your friends around you don't really know what's going on - but Paul does - every Christian that knows the Bible knows your heart better than you know your heart. I know the inner workings of your life even better than you do cuz God can see it and he's telling me - this is what they love, sin.

Again, observationally, I don’t think there’s a case that Christians are very different to non-Christians in these “smells”. And again, Tom dismisses that by making a claim that over half of the population are either liars or lunatics - _'they don’t really know what’s going on inside their own heads, but I do'_ - and the only justification for this claim, is his interpretation of this bit of the bible, which he hasn’t justified.

> They think that it's because they read a Richard Dawkins book, you think that you've outsmarted God and you actually understand that there's reasons and evidences not to be a Christian - I call your bluff, it is because you love sin, it is because you you have within you a bent towards that which is disgusting sinful and vile as every one of us naturally do...

Again, from my personal experience I know this to be false, and from the experience of my non-Christian friends I know this to be false. So to believe Tom I need to consider myself and many other people either liars or lunatics. I don’t think we are.

Of course I can’t _justify_ that to Tom, because he already doesn’t believe anything we do or say - so we’re stuck, unable to have a reasoned discussion about it.

> ...And (non-Christians Tom is evangelizing) will say 'I can't fault it - that resonates, it seems true' - how many times people have said something like that - 'I'm convicted, I'm teary eyed because of the guilt of my heart'...

In this example Tom gave no reasoning that the people accepted - they just _felt_ like it was true. Ironically, this to be relativistic, emotive-based truth, which conservative evangelicals tend to dislike?

> ... but - there is always a devilish butt _(sic - thanks YouTube transcript)_ - they love the lifestyle they are living. They cannot imagine life without their girlfriend... And my answer is always no, you don't have to clean up your life at all before you come to Jesus - stay with her, I don't care what's happening, nothing has to change, just come to Jesus in faith. But yes, obedience to Jesus will look like severing those ties, and those habits of sin in your life - he'll give you his Spirit to do it, he will help you, you'll be able - but I feel like maybe the ability to do it is not your problem. You don't _want_ to give that up - and here's the folly of sin is that it convinces you that what it can offer you is worth you going to hell for.

Okay, again, Tom hasn’t recounted any reasoning, any evidence that has convinced these people - he’s talked about the bible to them, and it’s resonated with them, it sounds good to them - and now he’s telling them to trust Jesus, and then, after that, cut off very important relational ties from their lives. That’s cultish. That’s very possibly damaging - it certainly makes them very vulnerable if they go through with it. I feel that without good evidence, without knowing why this resonates with you, it is very very reasonable to _not_ cut yourself off from your loved ones.

Now of course, there are many reasoned arguments you could have for and against the claims of Jesus - I’m not saying they don’t exist. See [Unbelievable](https://www.youtube.com/@PremierUnbelievable) for some good ones. But Tom is delivering this sermon with the premise that there are non-Christians in the audience, and he wants them to become Christians by the end of the night. He cannot assume all of them have heard an argument for Christianity, let alone a decent analysis of both sides.

And hold on a second - of course these people don't want to, they don't have free will - we've already been over that. So why is he even asking? Why is he promising God will help them change their minds before they have the ability to believe that?

> ...This has been my experience as a pastor, and is the wisdom of the Bible - every year that goes past you're in fact less fulfilled, you have more self-regret over the stupid and disgusting things that you've done - but you think 'if I pull out now I waste it all, if I keep on risking more I at least stand the chance of having a payout…'. I've tried to evangelize non-Christians over years and and tried to win them and it's so heartbreaking to think that years ago, they were not interested in Jesus at all - they were sure sin would pay off - and as the years have gone by I look at them and they're all just the more encased with their sin, they're all the more guilty in their heart - to be honest they hate themselves.
>
> Most people do, most people in our world despise who they see themselves to be. Most people lie and project some kind of self-confidence and self love which they do also hold in tension - they they love themselves but they hate who they see in the mirror. And as the effects of sin kick in, and then they do something sinful to manage that and to respond to that on and on every year comes the Deep self-pity And Regret and guilt that grows day by day by day because you refuse to come to the Lord Jesus Christ”

[A longitudinal investigation of the relation between nonsuicidal self-injury and spirituality/religiosity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28152395/) is a vaguely relevant study I guess - there are others too.

No, not everyone hates themselves. No, self-hatred isn’t caused by not being religious - it's not even correlated with being religious either way as far as I can tell.

I know plenty of friends who are Christian and have mental health struggles. And I know my own mental health improved drastically once I stopped trying to reconcile hell with goodness.

I will also note that Christian teachings _train_ you to be unsatisfied without God - you're told over and over that morality and happiness and love is impossible without God, and it takes you a while to figure out it isn't. I hadn't really thought about this until I watched [Genetically Modified Skeptic's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxgx5QAYMrU&ab_channel=GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic) on it. Not to mention, that having friends and family persistently trying to convert you, thinking you're going to hell, and thinking you're inherently immoral, can be pretty saddening.

So, if your friends hate themselves, rather than using that as leverage to make an emotive, not-thought-out decision, please encourage them to get therapy?

> God is a righteous judge - God is everywhere in the Bible pictured as as the judge of all the Earth, who made all, who rules all. And his law is the one and only standard of what is right and wrong, and it is the one and only eternal standard of what is good enough to be in heaven with him - and what is indecent and not good enough to be with him. So despite what every college professor has told you you are not going to face God and be asked on the last day how do you think you did.

Okay for one that is a silly analogy; “how do you think you did?” is a pedagogical tool (and a very good one) - not a _justice_ method.

More interestingly, this is awkward to hold together with the videotape analogy from earlier. What I feel guilty about and what Tom's God says is right and wrong have a substantial non-overlap. It's not an explicit contradiction, but it's a weak to say “you _know_ you're guilty - but also you don't know what you think you know, and also it's what you think is right and wrong doesn't matter anyway”.

Plus of course there's the question of how God defines good - especially important in this context as below we try to justify hell.

> God's old fashioned and he has a law and he intends to uphold it - he will measure you against it. He's already graciously published his law in the Bible so that we can know ‘where do I stand, right or wrong, just or unjust, righteous or evil?' - and every one of us by our idolatry, our blasphemy, our lying - by our stealing, our coveting, our filthiness - we are all, every single one of us, sinful through and through.

Is God’s law clearly defined in the bible? It’s notoriously difficult for Christians to agree on how to interpret the Old Testament law as it applies to non-Jewish, present day people. And the Old Testament doesn't say anything about the law being used to decide whether you’d go to hell. So - how accurately can you measure yourself against the law?

Also, what is idolatry? Don’t people get mad at Tim Keller about that?

> It's correct that God does punish things in Balance to the severity of the sin - but what causes sin to deserve an eternal hell is not that you're an eternal person, or that you have such an eternal power to commit such an affront against an eternal God. The reason that sin deserves an eternal hell is because it's committed against an eternal, infinitely, perfectly righteous God - he is what makes sin so horrible - his righteousness and his law.

Hmm. I’m not convinced by this claim. For a start, where is this argument in the bible? Further, does God choose to define sin and the appropriate punishment, or is it some kind of external reality (and does this leave us with a [Euthyphro dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma))?

> Surely if God loves you, if he's kind, he can just sweep your sins away - he can just say it's all good, he can let me in like a like a loving grandfather - he can wink at my sin and give me a lolly that that'll be fine? But none of us would be satisfied with an upright reputation of a judge if he was known for repeatedly acquitting and sending back back into the community all kind of sexual assaulters, violent men, beaters of their wives and children, thieves and abusers of the worst kind - not a single one of us would stand to hear that man called righteous, that's an evil judge. How much more so with God the righteous judge of all the Earth?

God does say sin will be all fine for Christians though, right? Why not apply the same mechanism to non-Christians?

God doesn’t even have to send non-Christians 'back out into the community' - there's lots of alternatives to torturing them forever. He could destroy them, or isolate them - or reform them! Since you don’t believe in free will anyway, what’s the harm?

And why stop there in your list of sin - would any of us be okay with a judge who 'acquits and sends back into the community' - people who have told a lie? People who work on Sundays? People who get divorced without their partner cheating on them, or who marry divorced women? People who are Hindus, or Muslims? Rich people? Ah - yes, I think most of us would be okay with a judge being okay with most of these things. Most of us would be pretty unhappy with a judge executing and/or torturing people for these things.

Some of those things in Tom's list of sins aren’t even explicitly sinful in the bible. Violence is endorsed in several contexts in the OT. Beating wives and children isn’t explicitly disallowed in the OT as far as I’m aware. What was permissible for the ancient Israelites to do to slaves and captives would likely count as sexual assault under Australian law today.

> What would you think of our King right now if during his coronation a terrorist jumped the red rope and ran past the King's Guard and delivered a hearty slap to the face of King Charles the Third - what would you think if that King chuckled it off and allowed him to be escorted peacefully out. You might think he's a nice guy but he's no fitting King - you would think of that man, that he has no esteem of his own weight, his own honor, and he cares nothing for the glory of his own kingdom - that is a terrible King - and yet this is what people want want God to be.

I don’t think a slap counts a terrorism and I have no idea why you think a slap counts a terrorism.

And I don’t think that King Charles is a fitting king, but if I did, this scenario wouldn’t change my opinion of him. Why should a guy whose great-great-grandfather killed a bunch of people with pointy sticks get un-slappable privileges? Sure, the slapper could get charged physical assault if Charles wanted to press them, same with slapping anyone - but if Charles is willing to forgive him, I’d see that as a good character trait maybe…?

And I certainly wouldn't think that Charles has the right to torture this guy just for a slap. So what's the threshold? How good does someone have to be for it to be okay to torture their slapper?

> God is in fact such a good King that he will retaliate in order to uphold his honor. We are the subjects that have come against our King with rebellion and slaps to the face and spitting on his Royal garb. As sinners we have dismayed, disgusted, insulted and polluted a High King - therefore he must do what needs to be done to redeem and reestablish his honor. God has said in no uncertain terms he will not let the guilty go unpunished, that he 'will render to each one according to his work'. Don't be in any doubt of it, God has warned you now so that you can flee it. If you go on living this life without faith in the Lord Jesus Christ you can be absolutely sure that the only place you are going is to the place of receiving everything you deserved for all of your sin.”

What value does eternal suffering give? How does it count as honorable, as cleansing, as redeeming to your name to torture your own creations forever, entirely at your own choice?

> If I gave us an activity to get a piece of paper and start writing down all of the sins that you can remember from your infancy upwards - you would get maybe a couple of months into your life as you're thinking of the timeline before you realize this is a horrible place to be.

Am I misinterpreting here or does Tom think that less-than-a year-old babies deserve to be burned alive?

> God will punish every sin that he's aware of, which is infinitely more than you are actually aware of. All of the the thoughts, the the background motivations, the hidden desires - you have no clue just how sinful you really are, but God does - and he tells you that for every single one of those sins there will be an exact payment, a wage given to you… an eternal torment of hell

Does it really count as just for God to create sentient beings with hidden flaws they aren’t even aware of, that they cannot fix without him, that they can fix with him - then to avoid fixing them - and then to punish them for it? How does that honor God? It makes him out to be - something nasty, that’s for sure.

> You will know it in a mind more logical than you're able to even imagine now - you will acknowledge this is what I deserve, this is what should happen and this is what God is giving me.

Again, this claim is conveniently unfalsifiable, undebatable - ‘You (majority of the human population that disagrees with me) are all illogical, self-deceived and/or insane, so it doesn’t matter what you think now - but you’ll see in the end, you’ll admit you deserve to be tortured.’

No, I would like to see some logic that my earthly human brain can comprehend before I decide that it is okay to torture the majority of humanity forever.

> If you're a Christian you've been caught, you've been brought to safety, you've been crowned with the dazzling jewels of Heaven - you're a child of God.

Off topic a little, but important to this one. Earlier Tom mentioned 'false Christians'. How can you tell? If eternal torment is on the line, you don’t want to have a scenario where people look like Christians, act like Christians, believe that they are Christians - but turn out to not be Christians. That would mean no Christian has real grounds for confidence, right? This is all very pointed because I looked and acted like a Christian and believed I was one, but am now not one - and I don't see how any Christian could have confidence they won't go the same way.

> While you dangle over hell, even at this moment, the good news is that God delights to give eternal life, and that eternal life is a free gift… God doesn't care what you deserve, when he's giving you the free gift of eternal life he is giving you a free gift.

So why doesn’t he give it to everyone, if he doesn’t care what they deserve? Clearly according to the calvinist he has the ability to give it to all - there’s no ‘free will rubbish’ getting in the way.

And why does God delight to give eternal life? Does life have an inherent objective value that he recognises - or does he just want something else out of it - or does he just arbitrarily choose that he cares about life?

> Spurgeon tells this story he was a preacher of another century of an old lady named Dorothy, and she was running behind on rent and impoverished - she heard a knock on a front door and she did what most introverted Millennials do... she goes and runs behind a couch and pretends she's not home - why didn't you call ahead, I'm not in the mood for being hospitable?

Was that jab at Millennials really necessary? Did shy people not exist in the past? Is social anxiety just a laughing matter? Does Tom take it as a personal affront when someone doesn't want him to walk into their house unannounced?

> She's nervous because she knows that a landlord is coming to exact from her the fees that she doesn't have. And she hears him going around the side of the house aand trying the back door and she's hiding. Now the next day at church the the pastor comes up and grabs her and says, ‘Dorothy where were you yesterday? I know you were home.’; ‘What are you talking about Pastor?’; ‘Because I'd done a collection amongst the young people at church and they desired to pay your rent for the next six months, I was looking for you and you wouldn't come to the door - I know you were home’. And she says ‘Oh I thought you were the landlord - I didn't have what I thought you were demanding.’
>
> Spurgeon makes a direct application to the gospel, he says this is how most non-Christians hear the preaching of the gospel. Maybe every time I say something about giving your life to Jesus you are hearing Jesus wants to take things from me that I know I don't have to give. I don't have a righteous life, I don't have money and I don't want to give things to the Lord Jesus Christ.
>
> The good news is, you're hearing me all wrong. Jesus is knocking on the door saying everything you owe I'm here to pay. Everything you don't have I'm here to provide. I am God's gift to you - God is giving a gift in Jesus Christ.

The difference is that the pastor is also the landlord, and the landlord will burn the lady in hell if she doesn’t accept the aid. I feel like it’s reasonable for the lady to be scared and run.

> This is how you get to heaven - know that your life is deathly and disgusting and you will find no joy in it outside of Jesus; know secondly that where you are headed is an eternal hell for the punishments of your sins; know thirdly that the father has in love given his son to give you eternal life in grace; and then lastly know that this eternal life is in Jesus Christ.

That’s toxic. You’re teaching people to think that themselves and non-Christians are deathly and disgusting and deserve eternal torture; you’re teaching people that all their other relationships have ‘no joy’ - and you’re saying ‘oh but it’s okay, just listen to me, I have the solution’. Tom, again, hasn’t attempted to evidence this - he’s just called everyone who disagrees a liar or a lunatic. What Tom has done is make the most emotionally stirring, scary picture he could and then offered the only way out.

> God did not send his son to come in show you how terrible you are - tighten your locks, laugh at you in jail slam, shut the door, go back to heaven and have a party with the angels in your absence.

Is Tom talking to everyone, or just the elect? Because under Calvinism non-elect people _are_ going to have the locks tightened, the doors slammed, and a party thrown without them - and under Calvinism, Jesus knew that, God knew that - planned it.

Further, Jesus _did_ heighten the rules. There was, again, no clear promise of hell in the OT. There wasn’t even a clear set of requirements for non-Jewish people - so didn’t Jesus come in part to show how terrible we were?

> Iram Judson was a missionary to Burma in the 1800s. His mother had tossed and turned between giving him her blessing or begging him to stay - should she tell him God doesn't want him to go, should she give him her full love and blessing? Knowing full well she would likely never see him again this thought came to her mind, this verse - ‘for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son’. She wrote to him a letter later saying in that moment:
>
> "I thought, if God could so love as to give his son how could I be so selfish as to keep back my own from the nations that do not know Jesus.
>
> She wept. It was bitter, but it was bittersweet for her. Now imagine if you were a Burmese person in the 1800s and here's this man preaching this news of salvation to you. And you wonder as you see this Western man standing in front of you - ‘should I listen and receive his message, or should I reject it?’ Could you imagine visiting Abigail, his mother, and asking her - ‘Here's this man in my nation all these miles away, should I listen to what he says?’ Everything within her would say
>
> "How can you ever think that I would give such a gift of the loss of my son, the life lived with my grandchildren - how can you think I would give that for anything other than that you would hear his message - of course receive it, take everything he's willing to give you, bleed him dry! That is why I gave him, and to do anything else is to pain me as a mother and waste my sacrifice."

Again, this is very emotive _but there’s no reasoning_.

Plenty of women have lost their sons for plenty of things - many of them willingly. I’m sure there were German mothers very proud of their sons dying for Hitler. I’m sure there are Muslim mother’s proud of their sons preaching Islam. I’m sure there’s environmental activists whose mothers are very desperate for people to listen to their children.

And yeah, this is sort of used as an analogy - but why include it? The analogy doesn’t do anything _except emotionally_.

> And this is what God says to you - that as a non-Christian, you know you're going to hell and yet this free gift is held out and you still feel unworthy - and God is saying to you through the book of Romans the only way to glorify him, the precise thing that he wants you to dom is not go to what you deserve.
>
> He doesn't desire to punish you for your sin’s earnings. He wants and desires that you make good on what Jesus died to procure, which is your salvation. He died to make possible this promised gift of eternal life - of course he wants you to take it - bleed Jesus dry if you dare, give it a crack, you never will! The worse the sinner you are the greater the glory God gets for saving you.
>
> Do not walk out these doors until you are sure that after death you will go to be with Jesus in heaven, and you have all of the promises in him by faith.

So now we have topped off the unevidenced claims, emotional threats, and demands to change your relationships once you accept, with time pressure. How is this not cultish? How is this not emotionally manipulative?

And how does Tom know the non-Christian knows they're going to hell? Does he think that he's proved it to them just now? Or does he think they inherently know? Either way, I'd disagree.
