# Antipatterns in Evangelical Discourse 

1. Unjustified Upset (before proving or showing that thereâ€™s anything wrong with a person, people or position, they are described as awful);
2. Oversimplifying the Other (strawmanning and conglomerating);
3. Presuming Politics (writing as if conservativism is assumed and obvious).


## Why write this?

So I've been reading this chunky thing _(hold up Carl Truman's rise and triumph of the modern self)_ and to be perfectly honest it's been kinda painful. I've been trying to put my finger on what exactly it is that makes is so painful, and I've got three things _(slide with the three things)_ - and I think they're actually not just annoying, they're kinda problematic. Now they're not present in all evangelical discourse, not by a long way - and they certainly aren't exclusive to evangelical discourse - but I do think at least some subsets of evangelical discourse do have a bit a tendency towards these. 

Now quickly if you're wondering if an evangelical is just someone who's really into 90s mech anime, when I say evangelical I'm referring to a broad type of Christian - they'll generally believe that this thing is God's word, and is both authoritative and barring translation issues error free - and they'll believe the most important thing anyone can do, is trust Jesus to forgive their sins, and call him their king.

So yeah, I'm going to go through these three problematic patterns - Im going to explain what they are, I'm going to point out a bunch of ways they show up in this book and in some other books and sermons and articles - and I'm going to explain what problems I think this can cause both for people for want of a better term, in the in group, in the out group and for when those two groups are interacting. 

I'm hoping if you're a writer or speaker of any dispossession this will help you see some things to watch out for in your own work - and if you're someone who reads or listens to, well, anything, but especially stuff from the evangelical sphere - I'm hoping this will help you notice some of these problematic patterns and be less effected by them. And of course, if you are noticing any problematic patterns in my writing/speaking, please do let me know.

## Antipattern 1: Unjustified Upset

The first annoying pattern - unjustified upset. What do I mean by this? Insulting, denigrating, desparaging a position - without giving any reasoning against it.

It might be a simple insult - calling a group of philosophers a "club of smug Cambridge elite"<sup>1</sup>

Well, it's something like poisoning the well, or mudslinging - but a little broader, and I don't know if it was intentional.
